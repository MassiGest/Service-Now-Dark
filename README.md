# Service Now Dark 2.0
### _Get on userstyles.org_

[![N|Solid](https://userstyles.org/ui/images/stylish-logo-2.svg)](https://userstyles.org/styles/180513/servicenow-dark-v2-by-gestdevelopment)

This is my attempt to add a dark theme to Service Now and freshen it up a bit.
Note that this is still very w.i.p. and something i do in my free time so i might not be 100% dark, but if you find anything just let me know!



## Installation

You need to install the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) extension or another css injector like application.

You can install this style from [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/180513/servicenow-dark-v2-by-gestdevelopment)
_OR_
Copy the css code and create a new style in the extension.

Also make sure to change `https://swing.service-now.com` to your own Service Now url!

Then you should be all set
